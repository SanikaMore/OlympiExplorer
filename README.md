# OlympiXplorer
I built an Olympics Data Analysis web app using Streamlit, Python, and Pandas to visualize Olympic data insights. The app offers modules for medal counts, country-wise performance, and athlete statistics, allowing users to explore trends across events. Interactive charts with Seaborn and Plotly make data exploration engaging and informative.
